# CART-Trees-and-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
This project aims to estimate obesity levels and the weight of a person using Decision Trees and Linear Regression (from Scratch) using Python. The dataset was obtained from the <u><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+">UCI Machine Learning repository</a></u> under the name of "Estimation of Obesity Levels" and credit is due to the owners of the data. This project relies on the use of Scikit, pandas, numpy and matplot. In order to run the project, just run on a terminal " **python3 main.py** ". The project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a CART Tree, meaning it can be used both for classification as well as regression tasks. For this implemtation, the criterions used for classification is entropy and for regression is mse (Mean Square Error). For interpretation of results, classifcation makes use of confusion matrices and accuracy scores while regression makes use of RMSE and R-Squared.
